/*A lot of C operators work exactly the way you expect them to. You use a plus sign (+) when you want
to add, and you use a minus sign (-) when you want to subtract. An expression includes one or more
operators. C programmers often use math expressions on the right side of the assignment operator
when filling variables with values, like this:*/

/*
totalSales = localSales + internationalSales - salesReturns;
C computes the answer and then stores that answer in totalSales.*/
///////////
/*
//////
If you want to subtract a negative value, be sure to put a space between the minus signs,
like this:
newValue = oldValue - -factor;


If you omit the space, C thinks youâ€™re using another operator, --, called the decrement
operator, described in
