    /*printf("counter is at %d.\n", ctr + 1);
This statement prints the value of ctr + 1 without modifying the value of ctr. It simply evaluates the expression ctr + 1 and passes the resulting value as an argument to printf. If you want to print the current value of ctr without changing it, this is the appropriate choice.

printf("counter is at %d.\n", ctr += 1);
This statement also prints the value of ctr + 1, but it has an additional side effect of incrementing the value of ctr by 1. The += operator adds 1 to the value of ctr and assigns the result back to ctr. If you intend to both print the incremented value and update ctr, this is the suitable option.*/

    printf("Counter is at %d.\n", ctr);

    printf("Counter is at %d.\n", ctr += 1);

    printf("Counter is at %d.\n", ctr);

    /*At first glance, you might think that the value of total is 13 because you learned earlier that
multiplication is done before addition. Youâ€™re right that multiplication is done before addition, but
compound multiplication is done after addition, according to the order of operators. Therefore, the 2
+ 3 is evaluated to get 5, and then that 5 is multiplied by the old value of total (which also
happens to be 5) to get a total of 25,*/
